This document describes how AI (ChatGPT) was used during the development of the Edzy Quiz App.

## How AI Was Used:
### 1. Feature Planning & Quiz Flow
ChatGPT helped in:
- Designing the quiz flow (start → questions → submit → feedback → summary)
- Deciding how retries, solutions, and timers should behave

  
Example Prompts:
- **Design a clean quiz flow for a Next.js app**
- **How should retry and solution reveal work in a quiz app?**

### 2. Component Design & State Management
AI assisted with:
- Breaking the UI into reusable components (QuestionCard, ProgressBar, Timer)
- Managing states for selected options, correctness, retries, and navigation

Example Prompts:
- **How to manage quiz state per question in React?**
- **Suggest component structure for a quiz app in Next.js App Router**

### 3. Data Fetching & API Integration
ChatGPT was used to:
- Integrate API calls using Axios
- Use TanStack Query v5 correctly with the object-based syntax

Example Prompts:
- **How to fetch quiz data using Axios and TanStack Query v5?**
- **Fix Bad argument type error in TanStack Query v5**
